# NgageMe

NgageMe is a dynamic way of tracking pupil engagement.
Currently the project is in its testing phase, and so listener engagement is tracked by a one-to-one pair with a human observer.
The observer inputs realtime data into the system whenever the listener's engagement changes, and the speaker is able to track this in an easy, colour-coded display.
This allows speakers to directly engage listeners with low engagement, track room engagement as a whole, and dymanically adapt to the energy in the room by changing the pace or spontaneously offering a coffee break!


To set it up, copy the repo and host the files on a server.
Listeners should navigate to the "observer" file, whilst the speaker should navigate to the "test" file.
